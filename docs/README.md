# CommandPlates

üèπ  bind commands to pressure plates (minecraft 1.12.2)

## Request

Minecraft version: 1.12.2

Suggested name: PressurePlates

What I want: I like to request a plugin to allow players to bind command or commands to pressure plates that will either execute the command(s) by player or console when the pressure plate is stepped on.

Ideas for command/permission:

pressureplate.admin

- /pplates create platename <true:false> <command_one, command_two> - Gives a pressure plate in which you can place down to execute the command. If set to true, the command will be execute by console. If set to false, it will be execute by the player. Use %player% in the command to replace the players name in commands

- /pplates list - Shows all available pressure plates

- /pplates info - While looking at a pressure plate, it will give you information about that plate

- /pplates info platename - Just another way to look up plate info directly by command


/pplates info
platename:
console: true/false
- command_one
- command_two

/pplates list
List of available pressure plates.
- platename
- platename2
- platename3

pressureplate.use
This is default player permission needed to use any of the pressure plates.

pressureplate.platename
Players would also need pressureplate.platename permissions to execute certain pressure plate

config.yml or pressureplates.yml to store all data

Thank you for reading.
