<img src="demo.gif" />

- Drop the `CommandPlates.jar` file into the `plugins` folder on your server.
- That's it! Only OPs can run commands unless the appropriate permission is given:
   - `pplates.admin` for the ability to create new plates
   - `pplates.use` for the ability to activate any plate
   - `pplates.<plate_name>` for the ability to activate a specific plate
- Run the following command to set up a Command Plate:
   - `/pplates create <name> <run_as_console:true/false> <command 1, command 2, ...>`
- Check in on plates by running (either as a player or as the server console):
   - `/pplates list`
   - `/pplates info <optional:plate_name>`
- Everything will be saved into the `plugins/CommandPlates/config.yml` file, which automatically fills in an example when running for the first time:

```yaml
plates:
  Example:
    author: insanj
    location:
      world: world
      x: 0
      y: 0
      z: 0
    console: true
    commands:
      - say Hello
      - say World!

```

How to Build
</h2>

```
make plugin
```

You will need `craftbukkit-1.12.2.jar` available on your machine. The [makefile](https://github.com/insanj/CommandPlates/blob/master/makefile) expects this to be in an `external/` directory that is not commited to git (you can change the path at the top of the file).

Original Request
</h2>

<a href="https://bukkit.org/threads/pressureplates.478872/
">https://bukkit.org/threads/pressureplates.478872/</a>

```

Minecraft version: 1.12.2

Suggested name: PressurePlates

What I want: I like to request a plugin to allow players to bind command or commands to pressure plates that will either execute the command(s) by player or console when the pressure plate is stepped on.

Ideas for command/permission:

pressureplate.admin

- /pplates create platename <true:false> <command_one, command_two> - Gives a pressure plate in which you can place down to execute the command. If set to true, the command will be execute by console. If set to false, it will be execute by the player. Use %player% in the command to replace the players name in commands

- /pplates list - Shows all available pressure plates

- /pplates info - While looking at a pressure plate, it will give you information about that plate

- /pplates info platename - Just another way to look up plate info directly by command


/pplates info
platename:
console: true/false
- command_one
- command_two

/pplates list
List of available pressure plates.
- platename
- platename2
- platename3

pressureplate.use
This is default player permission needed to use any of the pressure plates.

pressureplate.platename
Players would also need pressureplate.platename permissions to execute certain pressure plate

config.yml or pressureplates.yml to store all data

Thank you for reading.
